Added a gateway for Python programs. An example Python program is located in the examples directory.

Currently the gateway allows the SSF API to called from Python programs and allows queries to made on annotated corpus, using the the Sanchy Corpus Query Language.

Before running the Pythong program, the PythonGateway script has to run to start the gateway.
